The development goals are linked to the two main limitations of the backtester:

### Supported asset classes
The library supports Equities, Indices, FX and Equity like products which have a continuous timeseries of prices or returns. The backtesting of investment products based on the term structure (like Futures, or Fixed Income) is not supported.
Adding a possibility of chaining the contracts and therefore run long backtest on these instruments is an another development goal.
