        N
            the N-th future contract, counting from start_time. We assume the first nearest contract to be the 1st one.

            the method used to combine the the Nth contracts together into one data series, possible methods:
            - NTH_NEAREST - the price data for a certain period of time is taken from the N-th contract, there is no
            discontinuities correction at the contract expiry dates
            - BACK_ADJUST - the historical price discontinuities are corrected, so that they would align smoothly on the
            expiry date. The gaps between consecutive contracts are being adjusted, by shifting the historical data by
            the difference between the Open price on the first day of new contract and Close price on the last day of
            the old contract. The back adjustment considers only the Open, High, Low, Close price values.
            The Volumes are not being adjusted.
